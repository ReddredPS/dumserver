A modern Python MU* engine - re-imagined, actively developed and properly tracked.

## What is it?
DUM is a hobby project aiming to develop a feature-rich Python codebase for a sci-fi MUD style game. It is building on brillinat work by Mark Frimston, be sure to check out his Mud-Pi project (https://github.com/Frimkron/mud-pi).

## Try it out!
Go ahead an check out dumserver at http://146.148.38.131/

## Features
Head over to the [Wiki](http://dumengine.wikidot.com/dum-v0-1-feature-summary) for small breakdown of core features in the initial version 0.1. All changes/improvements/fixes since 0.1 are being documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Running the Server
```diff
- IMPORTANT - Python >= 3.6.7 is required (Ubuntu >= 18.04 LTS)!
```

```diff
- IMPORTANT - To avoid setup issues, please always install DUM on a fresh, dedicated Ubuntu instance!
```

1. Install the server in a folder of your choice using `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowpin/dumserver/master/installer.sh | bash && python3 <(curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowpin/dumserver/master/setup.py" -s -N)`
2. As a last step, the installer will try to detect your public IP address and set it in Webclient config files. You can also choose to provide the IP manually. 
4. `cd dumserver` and run it by typing `sudo ./start-server.sh`
5. If you are running an instance behind a firewall (e.g. Google Cloud), make sure any ingress traffic to port TCP 35123 is allowed - in order for the webclient to be able to connect to the python server. You will get a blank screen when connecting to the server otherwise.

Note: start-server.sh needs to be ran as root if Webclient is configured to run on port 80 (that's how it comes by default).

You now should be able to connect to your server on `http://<your-server-ip>`
